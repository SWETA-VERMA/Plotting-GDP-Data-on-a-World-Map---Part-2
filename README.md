# Plotting-GDP-Data-on-a-World-Map---Part-2
As the second part of our final project(coursera), you will improve the quality of the world map plots that you created using pygal in last week's project. This improvement will rely on creating a better mapping from pygal country codes to World Bank country names. When complete, your code should have graphical functionality similar to this page at the World Bank data site. The primary goal of this assignment is to gain more hands-on experience working with multiple dictionaries as well as using multiple data sources to reconciling conflicting information . The assignment will also expose the student to some typical issues that arise in cleaning and unifying multiple sets of data.
